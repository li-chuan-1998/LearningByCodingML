# Machine Learning Exploration Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning and understanding machine learning models through hands-on coding using simple Python code. The primary focus here is on readability and comprehension to ensure a smooth learning experience. However, performance is considered secondary in this context.

As we progress, PyTorch will be introduced for implementing and exploring more complex models, and where applicable, a comparative analysis of performance between PyTorch and scikit-learn implementations will be provided.
